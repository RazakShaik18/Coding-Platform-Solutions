# Minimum Cost to Acquire Required Items

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given five integers `cost1`, `cost2`, `costBoth`, `need1`, and `need2`.

There are three types of items available:

- An item of type 1 costs cost1 and contributes 1 unit to the type 1 requirement only.
- An item of type 2 costs cost2 and contributes 1 unit to the type 2 requirement only.
- An item of type 3 costs costBoth and contributes 1 unit to both type 1 and type 2 requirements.

You must collect enough items so that the total contribution toward type 1 is  **at least**  `need1` and the total contribution toward type 2 is  **at least**  `need2`.

Return an integer representing the  **minimum**  possible total cost to achieve these requirements.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  cost1 = 3, cost2 = 2, costBoth = 1, need1 = 3, need2 = 2

 **Output:**  3

 **Explanation:** 

After buying three type 3 items, which cost `3 * 1 = 3`, the total contribution to type 1 is 3 (`>= need1 = 3`) and to type 2 is 3 (`>= need2 = 2`).
Any other valid combination would cost more, so the minimum total cost is 3.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  cost1 = 5, cost2 = 4, costBoth = 15, need1 = 2, need2 = 3

 **Output:**  22

 **Explanation:** 

We buy `need1 = 2` items of type 1 and `need2 = 3` items of type 2: `2  *5 + 3*  4 = 10 + 12 = 22`.
Any other valid combination would cost more, so the minimum total cost is 22.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  cost1 = 5, cost2 = 4, costBoth = 15, need1 = 0, need2 = 0

 **Output:**  0

 **Explanation:** 

Since no items are required (`need1 = need2 = 0`), we buy nothing and pay 0.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= cost1, cost2, costBoth <= 106
- 0 <= need1, need2 <= 109

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumCost(int cost1, int cost2, int costBoth, int need1, int need2) {
        long long both = min(need1, need2);

        long long cost = both * min(costBoth, cost1 + cost2);

        if (need1 > need2)
            cost += (long long)(need1 - need2) * min(cost1, costBoth);
        else
            cost += (long long)(need2 - need1) * min(cost2, costBoth);

        return cost;
    }
};
```
